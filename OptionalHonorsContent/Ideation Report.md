Productivity hacks are ever-popular in a world full of digital distractions and the Pomodoro Technique one such method that can help you cut through the clutter. The technique, which takes its name from a tomato-shaped timer that inventor Francesco Cirillo used to track his work when he was a college student, aims to help you focus on tasks and conquer your to-do lists. Anyone who struggles with procrastination or feeling overwhelmed with large undertakings can see how this method can help tremendously.

The Pomodoro Technique is simple: you take large tasks and projects and break them down into smaller tasks and then tackle them over timed intervals, which are called Pomodoros. In between Pomodoros are scheduled breaks, during which you are encouraged to get up and stretch (if you're working at a desk) and do something fun or relaxing. In general, a Pomodoro lasts 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. After four Pomodoros, you get a longer break of 15-25 minutes.
